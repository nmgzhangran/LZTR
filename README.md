  A online questionnaire website deployed on Ali Cloud Server

  The website implements the core functions such as questionnaire generation, questionnaire filling, statistics and so on. The project team focused its research on providing users with a friendly interface and improving system performance and safety. The system has a three-tier architecture. We used SSH tools to achieve loose coupling system, and at the same time used both relational database and non-relational database to store different types of data. System was developed completely with the software engineering process. In the first stage, we conducted a preliminary survey of requirements and statutes, designed the overall structure and the database. In the second stage, we used github to manage project version. Team members took reference to the iterative plan to take on different responsibilities and completed the project. In the final stage, we tested the system and deployed the project on the server. We released a questionnaire named "Professional Choice Status Survey", which was used to conduct practical application testing. We collected 34 answers and some feed-backs or suggestions on the system, which provided the direction for further improvement of the system.
